The static variables are loaded into the RAM of the computer
when the program is first turned on, the non static variables stay on the 
hard disk as bytecode. only when it is called can the non static
variables be loaded. For example, if there is a static int = 10, this is loaded 
onto the memory in the start, but if there is a double = 15.22, and it is outside
the static methods and variables in the class it can only be loaded if you create
a new object for example.
