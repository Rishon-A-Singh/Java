Q3:

Suppose we have a class Person, which is a child class of Office and Home.
Suppose the methods inside the Person class make the person do actions.
In these 2 secenarios the person acts differently in the differnt envirionment.
So in the same way the methods for the person should do differnet things under differnt class.
To achieve this, the method in Home can be overriden to make the person do differnt actions.
method overriding is the way we can do dynamic polymorphism.
